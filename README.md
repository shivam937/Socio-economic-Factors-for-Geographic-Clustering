# Socio-economic-Factors-for-Geographic-Clustering
## Identifying the various clusters of countries that are more similar to each other than others, in terms of certain socio-economic factors.

#### We decide the number of clusters using a concept called Dendrogram which is a tree-like diagram that records the sequences of merges or splits.

 <li>We can see that the <i><b>complete linkage</b></i> gives better separated clusters. A cluster is considered better separated if the vertical distance connecting those clusters is higher.
  <li>Now, we can set a threshold distance and draw a horizontal line. The number of clusters will be the number of vertical lines which are being intersected by the line drawn using the threshold.
<li>The branches of this dendrogram are cut at a level where there is a lot of ‚Äòspace‚Äô to cut them, that is where the jump in levels of two consecutive nodes is large
<li>Here, we can choose to cut it at ~10 since the space between the two nodes is largest.
<li>Now, dividing the cluster into 4 groups:</li></ul>

  <li>Cluster analysis is an unsupervised technique that tries to identify subgroups among the observations that, with respect to certain characteristics, are similar to each other.</li>
  <li>All clustering techniques aim to group observations into subgroups/clusters so that:</li>
<ul>
  <li>Each cluster contains observations that are similar to each other. </li>
  <li>The cluster should be homogeneous with respect to certain clustering features.</li>
<li>The observations of one cluster are different from observations of other clusters. </li>
 <li>Each cluster is different from other groups with respect to the same characteristics.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
